2022-12-01 SRZ: Still waiting on some material, anticipating final startup in January 2023. 

2022-11-02 SRZ:  Still working on acquiring material for the final startup.  At this point will wind up needing to carry some work into January 2023 due to supply chain delays.  Have shifted some spend to January as a result.

2022-10-04 SRZ:  Startup of the outbound manifold PLC has been completed.  During prep work for the upcoming Inbound Manifold PLC replacement it was discovered that we are short several critical PLC modules.  Arseal is working on tracking down the missing parts.  This may present a problem with scheduling the inbound startup given recent supply chain issues.

11/9/22 MLG:  The increase in cost is due to the increase of the cost of materials from the time AFE was approved to the time when materials were purchased. In addition, the construction contractor quoted a different grade of steel as well as different steel connections when they submitted their proposal, the material was spec'd during engineering.  The steel connections required clips and stiffeners which resulted in more fabrication by the contractor.  After installation of the concrete pad ramps, it was determined that there was a construction error with the incline of 3 ramps.  The toe of the ramps were extended in order to repair the incline angle; additional concrete was required.  After the cover was installed, it was determined that light is needed under the cover due to the area being dark in the evening.  A Supplemental will issued.

11/5/22 MLG;  The variance is due to a forecasting error.  Once the cleanup was complete, all the roll off boxes had to sit onsite and wait for the US Ecology to provide the ok to remove the waste, which in turn would allow us to take roll off boxes off of rental.  Due to a delay with the US Ecology, the waste, disposal fees, and the rental of the roll off boxes did not have an estimated date of removal.  The boxes and waste were removed on 8/24/22, the estimated date of removal was a week after completion, but this took over a month.  The US Ecology would not provide an estimated date for approval nor for invoicing as well.  We were receiving rental costs while the roll off boxes remained onsite.

1/3/23 - Holding Accrual for WM.  There are still rolloffs onsite with spoil that EnviroServe has not picked up.  Working with WM to get them picked up. 12/2/22 - Timco submitted billing.  Holding accrual for Waste Mangement.  With the issues that WM had with getting dumpsters out there and then not being able to pick them up. I'm skeptical that this cost will end up coming in over budget. 


11/1/22 - Timco Completed the installation on 10/27/22.  Covering accruals for Timco Open PO amount. Pugh for Inspection costs and estimated accrual for Waste Management for spoil disposal.  


10/3/22 - Timco working on hydro excavation for utility locating.  Plan on installing pipe and structures week of 10/3 and completing work week of 10/10.  10/8/31/22 - TIMCO was awarded this project.  Materials were sourced in August.  Project work is scheduled to start on 9/12 with hydro excavation. 


8/2/22  This project is being rebid to Mills Excavating and Timco due to supply chain not finding a A/B grade contractor the first time.   Once pricing is received back from both vendors we will make a selection and move forward with a portion of the work.  The current accrual is for the additional scope for TAS to review thedrawings and make the necessary amendments from the review performed by Markella & Mark Bonenberger.   


7/5/22 - Working with Supply Chain.  This project was bid out to 3 vendors and currently we only received bids back from TCCI.  Unfortunately TCCI is a Cgrade in ISN so Supply Chain is trying to see if other vendors would be willing to work out in Council Bluffs.  6/1/22 - Waiting for bid packages to come back before proceeding with Phase 2 AFE.  5/2/22 - Variance is for half of TAS po for completing baseline review.  Met with Contractors and anticipate having initial bid back by 5/13/22  4/4/2022 -TAS Finishing the design review and plan on meeting two contractors the end of April to walk down the project and get bids.",4-Apr-23,"Griest, Barbara",,West,Pipelines and Terminals,Operating Infrastructure,,Sugar Creek,BETNB - BET COUNCIL BLUFFS,,"59,691",,,,"233,636",,"Clark, Dave","Spari, Markella",,,1,34649,,"Guest, ProSight",Independent,Aqua,28-Aug-19,Other Programs

2/28/23 - re-accruing 7,500 for Rockwell and accruing 6,900 for Vander Werf Electric.  Last update I had is that Steve was needing wiring connections for actuator and Joe was going to provide these.  After actuator is wired, need to schedule pipeline downtown to set limits and check operation locally and back to SCADA.  Also waiting on details of cost for communications equipment.  Have 8,000+ FCST for this but this could take months to see this post.

2/3/23 - paid Vander Werf invoice in Jan, re-accruing 20,000 for Rockwell.  Processed CO for Vander Werf to install Dairyland isolator.  Looks like we will also be installing 4G primary with VSAT backup.  Shifting some costs out a little longer since I currently do not have an install date for communications equipment.

1/5/23 - Re-accrual of 30,000 for Vander Werf Electric and accruing 20,000 for Rockwell Automation - just waiting for NIPSCO to schedule electrical install and delivery of delayed SS Enclosure for PLC.

11/28/22 - Metro Fence is done and Vander Werf is probably 80% complete so will accrue that for Nov.  Electrical inspection by NIPSCO was completed on the 14th and Vander Werf will be back after the Holidays to finish up their work after NIPSCO completes their portion of the new power service to the meter.  Delay in the PLC enclosure from RA will push the remaining work out into 2023.  Need to PO issued for Dairyland Isolator installation this month for Jan/Feb install.

11/1/22 - Work delayed to 11/7 due to lead time of concrete.  Sight draft of 12,000 posted in Oct and paid 2 invoices to RA totaling 8,634.23 

10/10/22 - var is due to missing new easement payment - mtg with landowner was pushed out to Aug 29th.  Work will not start until Oct 31st at request of landowner.  Actuator should be received in the 2nd half of Oct and Vander Werf should be completed in mid-Nov.  Expect RA work to be completed in Dec andactuator to be installed in Nov and commissioned in Dec.  New fence will be installed just as soon as electrical main feed and rack has been installed.  Accruing 3,072.19 for Rockwell Automation.


9/1/22 - paid TAS invoice in Aug, Turfbrothers invoice in Aug, and paid for PLC material from RA in Aug.  Dropping accrual for TAS.  Have Phase II AFE ready to go with an estimated cost of 30,000 for NIPSCO and 15,000 for new easement.  Just waiting for Sole Source to be approved for Vander Werf then their PO will be issued for the electrical work.  Also had call in Aug to discuss comm's back to SCADA.  Delivery of new actuator is 2nd half of Oct.  Currently waiting on ROW agreement with landowner to expand the fencing.  Need to get PO issued for 3rd Party Insp for 3 weeks.


8/1/22 - re-accruing 9,375 for TAS,expect this total cost to go down but waiting on final, additional easement costs plus electrical contractor costs before making adjustments.


7/2/22 - accruing 9,375 for TAS.  Turfbrothers should get the area cleaned up in Jul.  Working on plan/profile view of expanded site so we can get new easement negotiated.


5/31/22 -accruing 25% of PO to TAS for May.  Should receive actuator around late Oct.  Working on legal drawing for additional easement acquisition to expand fencing.


5/16/22 - Phase I AFE approved, will get PO's issued to TAS and Actuation Group.


5/3/22 - I have TAS proposal for Eng & Design, just waiting on quote for new actuator from Actuation Group so I can submit Phase I AFE,hopefully in May.


4/5/22 - have meeting scheduled on-site for Apr 18 to get started on ROW easement and fencing requirements for new footprint.  Will probably submit a Phase I AFE after the meeting to get started on procuring long lead items and start Eng & Design.

3/27/23 - submitted CO#1 to Spencer to paint the entire exterior of the building based on what RAM Construction found when they started removing the CMU above the windows.  Their total contract amount is now 75,975.  Need to accrue 25% billing for Mar.

3/20/23 - RAM Construction started work today after scheduling with Dennis.

3/1/23 - confirmed that RAM has two individuals PIC 2.0 trained and sent email to local ops.  Just need to pick a good time to start work once the weather breaks and starts to remain above 40 Deg F at night.

2/3/23 - RAM attended PIC 2.0 training at end of Jan so we just need to schedule the work once the weather breaks.

1/10/23 - sole source was approved and PO issued.  RAM Construction is now an A in ISN.  Sent LIVEsafe link to Robert with RAM to get his 2 supervisors PIC 2.0 training in Detroit area at end of Jan then we can get this work scheduled after the weather breaks.


1/3/23 - revised SSSP per Nick's comments - need to schedule this work once the weather breaks.

11/30/22 - received SSSP from RAM construction today and will review and send this to Nick Fennell for his approval.

11/8/22 - emailed Buckeye SSSP template back to RAM so they can fill out our template and need to schedule RAM personnel for PIC training and work through ISN Waiver.  Confidence level in getting this work started before cold temps arrive is going down so moving this FCST out to 2023.  If we can get everything completed for new vendor and temps are favorable we will try to get this completed in 2022.


10/31/22 - emailed HASP to Mike Sullivan and others for review on 10/24 and waiting on a reply back.  Supply Chain was working through insurance issues and still waiting on a resolution (RAM does not need pollution insurance since SOW does not impact operations aroundpiping).

9/28/22 - had Ram Construction reach out to me and will be on-site on the 29th for site visit to get a proposal from them.

9/19/22 - had to create a new MEXP project for this work since the original entry was setup under MCAP.  Moved the FCST over this new MEXP project entry and cancelled the MCAP project in OPPM.  All notes below were copied over from the original MCAP project.9/8/22 - sent out email to leadership to review this revised SOW and details.  Checked with M+J and they can get it completed in 2022 and the waterproof coating can be applied down to 20 Deg F.

9/3/22 - talked with M+J to revise their original proposal to make lintel repairs where needed over 5 windows, replace the concreteblocks over the windows with the appropriate blocks and paint all of these blocks with an approved, waterproof coating that will address the permeability of the other concrete blocks.  Just waiting on this revised proposal.

8/1/22 - I think the original mailingwas delivered to River Rouge instead of PM's office.  Talked with M+J today and they shipping theiroriginal proposal to office overnight mail.

3/2/23 - var is due to several PO's to Bodine Electric coming in under the full PO amounts (savings).

2/3/23 - var is due to additional costs to fully insulate the 2"" and 1"" vapor lines from new fuel gas connection to the superheater and flare pilot lines that are above grade.  Also have the flash fire costs hitting in Jan that will be re-classed once all invoices have been paid.  The negative amount in May is the flash fire repair cost that need to be re-classed to the casualty loss work order.  CWIP and Int charges have exceeded the original budget amount.  Majority of work is fully operational now.  Just have a few trailing items to complete once the weather breaks.  Should have the Supplemental AFE submitted in Feb.

1/2/23 - var is due to completing insulation work ahead of schedule.  Apache is wrapping up the insulation and outer covering.  Working to replace two 1"" ball valves and repaint piping damaged by flash fire.  Re-working heat trace in this area and replacing insulation after new coating has been applied.  Bringing in forced air system to heat the two temp propane tanks to keep pressure above superheater minimum requirement.

12/2/22 - Var is due to completing work ahead of schedule.  Going for another test of the tank now after sealing leaks for a 4th attempt.  2"" vapor line has been painted and Bodine is installing the two new circuits for the heat tracing and will start installing heat trace cable this month with insulation to follow on 12/19.  Remaining soil spoils to be removed this month and Jersey Barriers will be set 12/15.  Expected completion of heat trace is 12/15 on water lines.  Need to submit ECO for approval for new heat trace and insulation of 2"" vapor line.

11/1/22 - tank is up as of Oct 20th - Tarsco will be back on-site Nov 7th to start hydrotest with insulation installation to follow after successful hydrotest.  We have two temp. propane tanks feedingthe superheater/flare pilot light until we can obtain proposals for heat tracing 2"" vapor line and possibly installing a vaporizer near the superheater building.

10/4/22 - Looks like Tarsco will be delayed about 4-5 days due an issue at their coating plant.  Bodine should complete pre work for new electrical to water tank.  Meade andEIEC completing electrical cutover this week.  New injectors and tie in of propane line will occur next week.

9/1/22 - Var is due to receiving progressive billing from Tarsco for new fire water tank ahead of schedule.  Accruing 15,440 for TAS, 6,400 for Pugh Pipeline Services, 142,432 for Tarsco, 15,500 for Acuren Inspection, 1,450 for Dales Lawn Grooming, 19,200 for Badger Daylighting, 3,000 for United Rentals, and 40,000 for Meade.  Currently installing thenew 2"" water line, excavating for new septic system, and using guided wave to inspect 2"" line we plan to use.  New EAC (minus contingency) is 2,200,000.

8/10/22 - Mar 2023 FCST is receipt and installation of Maxon valve for superheater.

8/1/22 - var is due to Meade completing more work than forecasted, re-accruing 14,210 for ESDC, accruing 7,500 for Pugh Pipeline and 75,000 for Meade.-  conducted PHA on 8/1 and have a couple of action items to complete for the piping mods.  Adjusted the remaining FCST based on recently issued PO's and received proposals.No contingency in FCST.

7/3/22 - Var is due to receiving inv for geotechnical work early.  Re-accruing 17,527 for ESDC.

5/31/22 - May var is due to 2 week approval delay for surveyor to access site for new water line and overhead power lines, re-accruing 17,527.50 for ESDC and 3,500 for Blood Hound.  New accrual of 5,000 for TAS.

5/19/22 - moved FCST around to start construction in early July with water tank construction to start in Nov.

5/13/22 - entered req. for purchase of 500 kVA transformer - has an 8 week lead time - should see this sometime around Jul 8th.

5/3/22 - Apr var is due to issues getting an ISN approved driller on-site to complete the soil borings - accruing 5,000 for TAS, 25,000 for ESDC, 3,500 for Blood Hound, 1,291.75 for GHD.  New Eaton Switchboard to arrive in mid-June, still trying to get vendor added to purchase transformer.

1/3/23 Variance (+6k).  Some confusion as to what proj # to charge the Cory Jct to Indianola Jct portion of this run.  Was charging it to IC710CPE2201.  It appears that this is the proper project # even though it's from Midland to Indianola Jct.  I stopped charging to IC710 and charged here.  Will need to transfer funds over from IC710.  Will that be an accrual?  There is still no date for the Midland to Cory Jct portion of this ILI run.  What do I do with the $40k forecasted for IC710 in December?
