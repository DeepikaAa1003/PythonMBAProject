11/5/22 MLG;  The variance is due to a forecasting error.  Once the cleanup was complete, all the roll off boxes had to sit onsite and wait for the US Ecology to provide the ok to remove the waste, which in turn would allow us to take roll off boxes off of rental.  Due to a delay with the US Ecology, the waste, disposal fees, and the rental of the roll off boxes did not have an estimated date of removal.  The boxes and waste were removed on 8/24/22, the estimated date of removal was a week after completion, but this took over a month.  The US Ecology would not provide an estimated date for approval nor for invoicing as well.  We were receiving rental costs while the roll off boxes remained onsite.


11/2/22 MLG- The accrual of $58k is for the Waste Management Sustainability Services.  


10/11/22 - Negative actuals from dropped accruals, WM invoices amounted to less than expected. DC


10/4/22 MLG:  variances are based on delays from invoicing from the US Ecology and the Waste Management Group due to roll off boxes remained onsite for an extended period of time. awaiting final invoices.  Roll off boxes were removed 8/22/22.

8/2/22 MLG:  Variance due to delay with US Ecology and the Waste Management group.  Cattails have been removed but cannot be removed offsite due to delay in materials verification, which in turn is causing additional daily charges for the  roll off boxes.  The Environmental group is pushing US Ecology for resolution.

10/10/22 - var is due to missing new easement payment - mtg with landowner was pushed out to Aug 29th.  Work will not start until Oct 31st at request of landowner.  Actuator should be received in the 2nd half of Oct and Vander Werf should be completed in mid-Nov.  Expect RA work to be completed in Dec and actuator to be installed in Nov and commissioned in Dec.  New fence will be installed just as soon as electrical main feed and rack has been installed.  Accruing 3,072.19 for Rockwell Automation.


9/1/22 - paid TAS invoice in Aug, Turfbrothers invoice in Aug, and paid for PLC material from RA in Aug.  Dropping accrual for TAS.  Have Phase II AFE ready to go with an estimated cost of 30,000 for NIPSCO and 15,000 for new easement.  Just waiting for Sole Source to be approved for Vander Werf then their PO will be issued for the electrical work.  Also had call in Aug to discuss comm's back to SCADA.  Delivery of new actuator is 2nd half of Oct.  Currently waiting on ROW agreement with landowner to expand the fencing.  Need to get PO issued for 3rd Party Insp for 3 weeks.


8/1/22 - re-accruing 9,375 for TAS,expect this total cost to go down but waiting on final, additional easement costs plus electrical contractor costs before making adjustments.


7/2/22 - accruing 9,375 for TAS.  Turfbrothers should get the area cleaned up in Jul.  Working on plan/profile view of expanded site so we can get new easement negotiated.


5/31/22 -accruing 25% of PO to TAS for May.  Should receive actuator around late Oct.  Working on legal drawing for additional easement acquisition to expand fencing.


5/16/22 - Phase I AFE approved, will get PO's issued to TAS and Actuation Group.


5/3/22 - I have TAS proposal for Eng & Design, just waiting on quote for new actuator from Actuation Group so I can submit Phase I AFE,hopefully in May.

8/25/2022 - Project pushed to 2023 to address overall MCAP budget. Remaining forecast moved to Q1 2023.


8/3/22 I have pushed the schedule a month.  See below.  In addition we are working from a verbal confirmation from railroad, I still have nothing in writing.


8/2/22 Just received notice from railroad that flaggers are not available to start until 8/29/22.  Will need to make decision whether or not to push purge into October.  I estimate needing 3 weeks for excavation.  An 8/29/22 start date only provides 2 weeks for excavation.  Will make decision prior to this forecast being due and will adjust forecast if necessary.


8/1/22 Variance (+), spent more on materials than originally estimated.  Hopefully receive railroad permit by end of this week.  Scheduling dept requested that we do purge week of 9/12/22.  In order to meet this date, we'll need to begin excavating by 8/22/22.

1/3/23 Variance (+6k).  Some confusion as to what proj # to charge the Cory Jct to Indianola Jct portion of this run.  Was charging it to IC710CPE2201.  It appears that this is the proper project # even though it's from Midland to Indianola Jct.  I stopped charging to IC710 and charged here.  Will need to transfer funds over from IC710.  Will that be an accrual?  There is still no date for the Midland to Cory Jct portion of this ILI run.  What do I do with the $40k forecasted for IC710 in December?
