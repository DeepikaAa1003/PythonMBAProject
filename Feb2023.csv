This was originally designed to be a deep well, and the drilling survey showed bed rock at approximately 20ft depth. The design was modified to be a distributed ground bed and ROW began working on securing a new easement with the landowners. The landowner has just indicated that they are not approving this easement and installation. The process to complete the easement for the alternate location will require engineered drawings, and a longer approval process that will not be able to be completed in time for a 2021 completion.

2022-11-02 SRZ:  Still working on acquiring material for the final startup.  At this point will wind up needing to carry some work into January 2023 due to supply chain delays.  Have shifted some spend to January as a result.

2022-10-04 SRZ:  Startup of the outbound manifold PLC has been completed.  During prep work for the upcoming Inbound Manifold PLC replacement it was discovered that we are short several critical PLC modules.  Arseal is working on tracking down the missing parts.  This may present a problem with scheduling the inbound startup given recent supply chain issues.

2022-09-01 SRZ:  Startup of the outbound systems is still on track for the week of 9/12.  Once the outbound is complete, will begin scheduling of the inbound manifold.  Still anticipate having all work complete prior to the end of 2022.

2019-06-04 SRZ:  Working with M&QC on quality concerns related to potential pump back system for leak detection.  Initial work with Scada/Leakwarn SME's has indicated that pump back system would be better suitedfor this application than any attempt at shipper side metering.",3/3/2023,"2022-02-08 NAW: No spend forseen in February, allocated spends into April & May. 


2022-01-04 SRZ:  $30k variance as a result of not getting construction started in 2021.  Shifted some funds out of January since was not able to get meeting with Bolt set up in December as planned.  Steve Guenther is going to assign a PM from his group to assist in getting the construction schedule back on track to keep our spends early in 2022.

2021-12-02 SRZ:  Some additional construction costs have slipped into next year.  Looking at possibility of bringing in a contract PM to help get project timeline back on track.

2021-11-02 SRZ:  Valve actuators have shipped to Energy Products for mounting.  Other materials are experiencing extended delays as a result of shortages.  Where possible have been looking at alternate sources etc.  Additional spend will slip into 2022 at this point.

2021-10-04 SRZ:  Working on getting contractor bid meetings set up.  

2021-09-02 SRZ:  Shifted some spending to 2022 to match realistic expectations.  Some materials are becoming difficult to procure and bid meetings have not yet been scheduled resulting in shift in the construction schedule.

2021-08-02 SRZ:  Accrued material cost for valves that have been set aside at Energy Products (they should be invoicing shortly).

2021-07-02 SRZ:  Adjusted forecast for current material delivery expectations.

2021-06-02 SRZ:  Re-adjusted forecast to accommodate current material delivery dates.  Underspend in May as a result of material not being ordered as originally planned.

2021-05-04 SRZ:  Shifted forecasts for construction dollars out due to delays in design and material ordering.

2021-04-05 SRZ:  Shifted forecasts out slightly due to final design stretching out longer than originally planned.

2021-03-02 SRZ:  Shifted funds for material out to match current projection.

2021-02-02 SRZ:  Pushed forecast out slightly as long lead material I originally hoped to receive in February will be further out.

2021-01-05 SRZ:  Cutting purchase orders for long lead material.  Most items are 6-8 week delivery which should allow us to meet thecurrent forecast.

2020-12-01 SRZ:  AFE approval process took longer than planned resulting in long lead material not having been ordered when original forecast.  Forecast has moved additional spend into 2021 as a result.

2020-11-01 SRZ:  Underspend in October due to delay inAFE approval.  Accrued for final design engineering which has begun.  Adjusted 2021 forecast for total cost of phase 2 AFE as submitted.

2020-10-05 SRZ:  Shifted forecast per likely AFE Approval.  Underspend in September due to AFE delay.

2020-09-02 SRZ:  Underspend in August due to delay in AFE submittal.

2020-08-03 SRZ:  Adjusted forecast to match proposed AFE and shifted funds in 2021 to match actual timing of expected spends.

2020-07-01 SRZ:  Have reduced overall forecast amounts to be more in line withexpected AFE that will be filed.

2020-06-01 SRZ:  Forecast on target at this time.

2020-03-26 SRZ:  Shifted forecast to move all field construction costs to 3rd quarter.  Engineering currently on holdpending Buckeye developing the companywide approach to these types of systems.  Will restart engineering if determination on our companywide plan is made.

2020-03-02 SRZ:  Reduced March forecast due to project design being on holduntil Leak Detection Team makes company wide decision on how Buckeye will implement these systems.

2020-03-02 SRZ:Reduced March forecast because costs hit end of February instead of March.

2020-02-03 SRZ:  Preliminary design is running ahead of schedule, resulting in more spendshitting in January than was forecast.

2020-01-02 SRZ:  Planned 2019 spends occurred as planned.  As a result of the recent DOT ruling, the project may encompass all the Rochester lines this yearinstead of only one.  If so, additional AFE funding will come from the Leak Detection Drawdown Budget.

2019-12-02 SRZ:  Remaining2019 spends will happen as planned with preliminary engineering work.  Currently forecasting only originally planned spends, though it is possible that the 2020 budget may include funding for all 6 shippers (7 lines) instead of only 1 test case, as a result of a new ruling from DOT.

2019-11-01 SRZ:  Remaining 2019 spends on track.  2020 spends will be better developed once preliminary engineering is complete.

11/5/22 MLG;  The variance is due to a forecasting error.  Once the cleanup was complete, all the roll off boxes had to sit onsite and wait for the US Ecology to provide the ok to remove the waste, which in turn would allow us to take roll off boxes off of rental.  Due to a delay with the US Ecology, the waste, disposal fees, and the rental of the roll off boxes did not have an estimated date of removal.  The boxes and waste were removed on 8/24/22, the estimated date of removal was a week after completion, but this took over a month.  The US Ecology would not provide an estimated date for approval nor for invoicing as well.  We were receiving rental costs while the roll off boxes remained onsite.


11/2/22 MLG- The accrual of $58k is for the Waste Management Sustainability Services.  


10/11/22 - Negative actuals from dropped accruals, WM invoices amounted to less than expected. DC

8/2/22 MLG:  Variance due to delay with US Ecology and the Waste Management group.  Cattails have been removed but cannot be removed offsite due to delay in materials verification, which in turn is causing additional daily charges for the  roll off boxes.  The Environmental group is pushing US Ecology for resolution.

2/3/23 - var is due to additional costs to fully insulate the 2"" and 1"" vapor lines from new fuel gas connection to the superheater and flare pilot lines that are above grade.  Also have the flash fire costs hitting in Jan that will be re-classed once all invoices have been paid.  The negative amount in May is the flash fire repair cost that need to be re-classed to the casualty loss work order.  CWIP and Int charges have exceeded the original budget amount.  Majority of work is fully operational now.  Just have a few trailing items to complete once the weather breaks.  Should have the Supplemental AFE submitted in Feb.

1/2/23 - var is due to completing insulation work ahead of schedule.  Apache is wrapping up the insulation and outer covering.  Working to replace two 1"" ball valves and repaint piping damaged by flash fire.  Re-working heat trace in this area and replacing insulation after new coating has been applied.  Bringing in forced air system to heat the two temp propane tanks to keep pressure above superheater minimum requirement.

12/2/22 - Var is due to completing work ahead of schedule.  Going for another test of the tank now after sealing leaks for a 4th attempt.  2"" vapor line has been painted and Bodine is installing the two new circuits for the heat tracing and will start installing heat trace cable this month with insulation to follow on 12/19.  Remaining soil spoils to be removed this month and Jersey Barriers will be set 12/15.  Expected completion of heat trace is 12/15 on water lines.  Need to submit ECO for approval for new heat trace and insulation of 2"" vapor line.

11/1/22 - tank is up as of Oct 20th - Tarsco will be back on-site Nov 7th to start hydrotest with insulation installation to follow after successful hydrotest.  We have two temp. propane tanks feeding the superheater/flare pilot light until we can obtain proposals for heat tracing 2"" vapor line and possibly installing a vaporizer near the superheater building.

10/4/22 - Looks like Tarsco will be delayed about 4-5 days due an issue at their coating plant.  Bodine should complete pre work for new electrical to water tank.  Meade andEIEC completing electrical cutover this week.  New injectors and tie in of propane line will occur next week.

9/1/22 - Var is due to receiving progressive billing from Tarsco for new fire water tank ahead of schedule.  Accruing 15,440 for TAS, 6,400 for Pugh Pipeline Services, 142,432 for Tarsco, 15,500 for Acuren Inspection, 1,450 for Dales Lawn Grooming, 19,200 for Badger Daylighting, 3,000 for United Rentals, and 40,000 for Meade.  Currently installing thenew 2"" water line, excavating for new septic system, and using guided wave to inspect 2"" line we plan to use.  New EAC (minus contingency) is 2,200,000.

5/19/22 - moved FCST around to start construction in early July with water tank construction to start in Nov.

5/13/22 - entered req. for purchase of 500 kVA transformer - has an 8 week lead time - should see this sometime around Jul 8th.
