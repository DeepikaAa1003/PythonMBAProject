6/2/23 - issued LOI to Degen, AFE was approved today, will get PO issued to Degen, get this scheduled and then get inspector request entered into system.

5/24/23 - Helmkamp provided a bid that higher than Degen.  Assembling the AFE based on Degen bid and will submit for approval.

5/12/23 - per supply chain, Degen provided a bid and all others declined.  I reached out to Helmkamp and Klump Excavating to see if they could provide a bid.

5/1/23 - Supply Chain only received one bid from Degen.  They are reaching out to the other two bidders to see if this is a no-bid or do they need additional time.

4/10/23 - created bid event in Coupa on Apr 7th.

4/1/23 - have complete list of bidders now by location and will get a Coupa bid event created in Apr for the Phase II construction.

2/28/23 - Sent emails out to 10 contractors to see which locations they want to bid on for dike work in 2023.  I've received 6 responses back to date.  Should have bid event created in Coupa in Mar for this project.

2/3/23 - need to check with 3 contractors in Feb to confirm they will bid on this project and get a bid event setup in Feb/Mar so we can start work once the weather breaks.

1/1/23 - no change in status - work pushed out to 2023.

11/30/22 - pushing this work out to 2023 and will re-bid this in Q1 2023.

10/31/22 - still waiting on proposals - construction will not start until Q2 2023.

10/1/22 - waiting on proposals from Klump and Degen, this will probably be a 2023 project due to the asphalt work.  Might be able to complete the dike work in 2022 - dropping 481 accrual.

9/9/22 - moving this FCST out to 2023 - not 100% sure contractors are available for this work for the remainder of 2022.  Will attempt to get work completed in 2022 but planning for worst case scenario since cutoff for 2023 FCST's is near.

9/3/22 - the bid event had issues and nobodyfrom Supply Chain followed up to see how this was progressing.  Wasted 1 month on this and starting the bid process over again.  I will be reaching out to all bidders the week of Sep 6th to make sure they have everything they need.

2023-05-29 - Uncovered and replaced section along the 14” Premium Gasoline Line that crosses the dike earth wall.  Applied coating and wrapped lines with corrosion inhibitor for underground application. 

Note:  May Actual was higher than projection basically by late invoice for crane and rigging not accrued in April ($14K).   Decision made to replace section (14” PUL) that cross the earth dike due to heavy corrosion condition on both sides. 

2023-05-03 -  replaced sections of pipes along the 14” Premium Gasoline Line.  25 weld saddle patches also installed.  The Line sections were precoated for installation.  This pre-work contributed to April overspend as compared to forecast.

6/5/23 - variance is from internal labor for dig  documentation.
5.8.23 - $-95,666 forecast in May due to MEXP Flip to OD531YOE2301 (AS)


5/1/23 - variance is PPS invoice for documentation.
4.6.23 - added -$72,600 to March for MEXP Flip OD531YOE2301 (AS)

4/3/23 - variance is from under-accrual and last dig.  Extreme wet weather made access difficult and required extra equipment (dozer, 2nd hoe) to access dig site.

3/8/23 - high water conditions at lake dig caused this dig to be delayed.  Will complete it at the end of the year when lake level is lowered.  Changed forecast accordingly.

3/7/23 - changed forecast to complete last dig in March.  Permits for 211 digs fell through so they will stay on these.

3/1/23 - variance is from work completed ahead of schedule.  Accrued some for contractor and inspection. Two digs left. One dig may push until April due to water levels in the reservoir and the proximity of the dig to that. Also adjusted March forecast so crew can go work on 211 immediate dig.

2/1/23 - Variance is from under accruing last month ($7243), and Percheron ($2365). Actual here does not match COGNOS ($13,155 vs $9608).. 
Adjusted forecast based on contractor's schedule with other dig projects that have become more pressing than these.

1/3/23 - variance is from an extra dig being completed.  Accrued $15K (Degen), $5581 (MNT) for that dig. Adjusted forecast based on new schedule.

12/2/22 - Two DOT-60 digs to start 12/5/22.

8/3/22 I have pushed the schedule a month.  See below.  In addition we are working from a verbal confirmation from railroad, I still have nothing in writing.


8/2/22 Just received notice from railroad that flaggers are not available to start until 8/29/22.  Will need to make decision whether or not to push purge into October.  I estimate needing 3 weeks for excavation.  An 8/29/22 start date only provides 2 weeks for excavation.  Will make decision prior to this forecast being due and will adjust forecast if necessary.


8/1/22 Variance (+), spent more on materials than originally estimated.  Hopefully receive railroad permit by end of this week.  Scheduling dept requested that we do purge week of 9/12/22.  In order to meet this date, we'll need to begin excavating by 8/22/22.


7/5/22 Variance + Missed an accrual.  Waiting on Railroad Permit and Railroad Flagger Schedule.  Will move some forecast $$ later into Q2.

2023-06-06 SRZ:  Have completed pre-startup visit and have identified some material we are still short of for the startup.  Working on alternate sources for the material.

2023-05-03 SRZ:  Have scheduled pre-startup site visit for 5/9.  Anticipate we will be able to schedule the startup of the remaining PLC after this visit.  Startup likely to occur in June/July time frame.

2023-04-04 SRZ:  Competing priorities have kept us from scheduling the startup for the Inbound system, but we are anticipating that we should be able to get things in order to complete the startup in the May/June timeframe.

2023-03-02 SRZ:  We have now received the bulk of the material we were waiting on. Working on scheduling startup with pipeline/technician/integrator schedules.

2023-02-02 SRZ:  Still awaiting delivery of some key material.  Startup will be delayed to March at the earliest.

2023-01-03 SRZ:  Some critical material is still delayed.  Anticipating startup will be moved to late February after final material arrives.

2022-11-02 SRZ:  Still working on acquiring material for the final startup.  At this point will wind up needing to carry some work into January 2023 due to supply chain delays.  Have shifted some spend to January as a result.

2022-10-04 SRZ:  Startup of the outbound manifold PLC has been completed.  During prep work for the upcoming Inbound Manifold PLC replacement it was discovered that we are short several critical PLC modules.  Arseal is working on tracking down the missing parts.  This may present a problem with scheduling the inbound startup given recent supply chain issues.

2022-09-01 SRZ:  Startup of the outbound systems is still on track for the week of 9/12.  Once the outbound is complete, willbegin scheduling of the inbound manifold.  Still anticipate having all work complete prior to the end of 2022. [Most likely operational by Nov 30th, with a few spends in Dec, per SZ]

2022-08-02 SRZ:  Startup has been postponed till week of September 12th.  The nitrogen purge that we are coordinating with has slipped until that week.

2022-07-05 SRZ:  Initial startup has been scheduled for the week of August 22nd.  There will be a week long shutdown on the 724 system scheduled for a nitrogen purge and cutout.  We will plan to start up the Outbound Manifold PLC that same week to take advantage of the down time.

2022-06-02 SRZ:  Startup of remaining portions of the project are still on hold as a result of competing priorities.

2022-05-02 SRZ:Startup of remaining portions of the project have been delayed temporarily as a result of competing priorities.

06-01-2023 - MNH - Still working with program manager for a resolution and plan forward on this. Putting project on hold for now. Project EAC still at $59K and moving forecast out a month.


05-02-2023 - MNH - We go more leak alarm so back on the drawing board. Working with program manager for next steps. We did check the alarm with SCADA last month. Project EAC still at $59K. Forecast moved out a month due to issues in getting alarms configured.


04-01-2023 - MNH - PLC leak alarms are monitoring better now. ARSEAL working with SCADA & Orin to get alarm points to CC & leak detection teams. Project EAC still at $59K. Forecast moved out a month due to delay in getting alarm to CC.



03-01-2023 - MNH - PLC leak alarms are monitoring better now. Will now work with SCADA & Leak detection group to get the alarm over to CC. Project EAC still at $59K.


02-01-2023 - MNH - Worked with Ops and made some adjustments to set point. Will now monitor the line to see if PLC model detects leaks properly now. This will continue for another month followed by leakwarn implementation. Prject EAC still at $59K.

09-27-2022 - MNH - Testing continues but not fully favorable. Moving money into 2023 to account for other leak detection method needed for this line if current PLC testing does not give us successful results over next month or so.


09-02-2022 - MNH - PLC program changes were done in August and now we need to test the program for 4 week followed by moving to leak detection for testing into SCADA environment. Project may come under budget if this test is successful. September forecast moved to Q4 as a place holder.


08-02-2022 - MNH - PLC program changes underway as part of some action items. Next step is to move leak detection for testing to SCADA test environment. Project may come under budget if this test is successful.


07-06-2022 - MNH - Discussions & analysis with CC & Leak detection team brought up more action items before this line can move to CC. We will work with program owners to get additional guidance on resolution of those action items. Moving July forecast to August.

06-01-2022 - MNH - Will try to move this line to CC by end of this month. Ifthat is successful, the remaining forecast on the project won't be needed.

03-02-2022 - MNH - Leak detection monitoring underway at the PLC level but not looking promising as the pipe doesn't hold pressure over 1 hour window and loses 20 psi over 1 hour from initial pressure of 35 psi. We made further tweak to the program to see if we get better results before moving monitoring to SCADA/CC. March forecast now moved to April as a backup if we need to install PPA solution

02-02-2022 - MNH - Cost savings on project so forecast reduced by $10K. Leak detection monitoring underway at the PLC level and will continue this and next month before moving to SCADA/CC. March forecast is as a backup if we need to install PPA solution.

01-04-2022 - MNH - Cost savings on project so forecast reduced by $10K. Leak detection monitoring underwayat the PLC level and will continue this and next month before moving to SCADA/CC. March forecast is as a backup if we need to install PPA solution.

12-02-2021 - MNH - new BPCV was installed successfully and leak detection monitoring at PLC level to start this month. If that fails, we mayhave to go to PPA solution. Adding forecast into Q1 of 2022 if we need PPA solution otherwise project will come under budget.

5/11/23 - received quote from United Electric for Multiload wiring and Fiber patch panel install.  $78,000 for the switchover from AccuLoad III to Multiload and $11,000 to install new conduit/wiring to new additive injectors.  Working to get Degen down there sometime in early June to provide a quote for mechanical work to re-pipe and add two injectors for each lane on the Blend Arms.

5/1/23 - walked this down with Doug Olds, local ops, and Jason McEnaney (United Electric) on 4/27.  Expect to have a proposal by 5/12 then will assemble full AFE to see if we can fund the construction in 2023 or push this off to 2024.  United Electric would have a hard time starting this work in Q2 or early Q3 so finding a qualified electrical contractor to complete this in 2023 could be a major issue that would push this out to 2024.

4/21/23 - just received dwg package today from Triad - need to schedule a site walkdown with local electrical contractor, Doug Olds, and local ops.

3/31/23 - Var. is due to Multiload material shipping quicker than expected.  Terminal has received the 2 Multiload and Triad has received all of the FCMII Modules mid-March.  Just waiting on drawings from Triad so we can walk down the electrical work with a contractor and obtain a proposal for this work.  Triad shouldhave IFR drawings in about 3 weeks.

2/28/23 - submitted Phase I AFE for approval based on estimated costs for TopTech material and quote from Triad.

2/3/23 - just waiting on a Eng & Des proposal from Prajj with Triad so I can submit a Phase I AFE.",30-Jun-23,"Hill, Elizabeth",,West,Pipelines and Terminals,Operating Infrastructure,,Southern Ohio,BETVL - BET LOUISVILLE,,"88,639","8,242","10,000","10,000",,"167,181","Younce, Michael","Potter, Eric",,,1,41879,,"Guest, ProSight",Independent,Aqua,21-Aug-21,Other Programs

6/2/23 - The variance is still due to the reclass for the material.  For some reason Additive systems which was for another project (BETAK) was booked for 68K and it should have only been for 42,290.  Another 26K will have to be pulled from this project.  I am trying to track down why this vendor was booked at 68K as the PO was only written for 42,290 and it was on the wrong project.  -23700 in July is to account for the additional reclass of cost which balances the project


5/1/23 - Variance is due material receipt on wrong project and needs reclassed.  Valve was received.  Working with operations to set up time to completed the drain up and change out of the valve.  This is more than likely going to happen the last week of May.  


Additionally - This project is not in supplemental.  The charges for a seperate project were some how accidentally coded to this project.  A negative cost was forecasted in June to account for the reclass that will be submittted for the error




4/3/23 - Valve was received, just needs to be receipted so billing can come through.  


3/1/23 - Valves were received, accrual is for this material that hasnt been billed yet.  Forecast is for installation of valve, which is scheduled in conjunction with proposed Demarcation work.  


2/2/23 - Accrual is for Valve that has been purchased.  Install still scheduled for when we perform the demarcation project.  


1/24/23 - Pushed the valve install out to April.  This will be getting completed during a scheduled outage at Granville.  
1/3/23 - This variance is due to the having to resubmit the AFE on the new AFE template since I had costs for this project split between December and January for the install.  PMO wanted this resubmitted and I had forgotten about it due to the timing of the Leak Detection testing and then Vacation late in the month.  12/2/22 - Submitted AFE for the purchase of the manifold valve and adapter plate.

In addition, the construction contractor quoted a different grade of steel as well as different steel connections when they submitted their proposal, the material was spec'd during engineering.  The steel connections required clips and stiffeners which resulted in more fabrication by the contractor.  After installation of the concrete pad ramps, it was determined that there was a construction error with the incline of 3 ramps.  The toe of the ramps were extended in order to repair the incline angle; additional concrete was required.  After the cover was installed, it was determined that light is needed under the cover due to the area being dark in the evening.  A Supplemental will issued.

11/5/22 MLG;  The variance is due to a forecasting error.  Once the cleanup was complete, all the roll off boxes had to sit onsite and wait for the US Ecology to provide the ok to remove the waste, which in turn would allow us to take roll off boxes off of rental.  Due to a delay with the US Ecology, the waste, disposal fees, and the rental of the roll off boxes did not have an estimated date of removal.  The boxes and waste were removed on 8/24/22, the estimated date of removal was a week after completion, but this took over a month.  The US Ecology would not provide an estimated date for approval nor for invoicing as well.  We were receiving rental costs while the roll off boxes remained onsite.

 Actual construction costs were completed within the original budget.  Additional services are what created the overage.  I will submit the Supplemental and the funding will come from the descrease in the phase 2 project that is budgeted for 300K later this year.

11/1/22 - Timco Completed the installation on 10/27/22.  Covering accruals for Timco Open PO amount. Pugh for Inspection costs and estimated accrual for Waste Management for spoil disposal.  


10/3/22 - Timco working on hydro excavation for utility locating.  Plan on installing pipe and structures week of 10/3 and completing work week of 10/10.  10/8/31/22 - TIMCO was awarded this project.  Materials were sourced in August.  Project work is scheduled to start on 9/12 with hydro excavation. 


8/2/22  This project is being rebid to Mills Excavating and Timco due to supply chain not finding a A/B grade contractor the first time.   Once pricing is received back from both vendors we will make a selection and move forward with a portion of the work.  The current accrual is for the additional scope for TAS to review thedrawings and make the necessary amendments from the review performed by Markella & Mark Bonenberger.   


7/5/22 - Working with Supply Chain.  This project was bid out to 3 vendors and currently we only received bids back from TCCI.  Unfortunately TCCI is a Cgrade in ISN so Supply Chain is trying to see if other vendors would be willing to work out in Council Bluffs.  6/1/22 - Waiting for bid packages to come back before proceeding with Phase 2 AFE.  5/2/22 - Variance is for half of TAS po for completing baseline review.  Met with Contractors and anticipate having initial bid back by 5/13/22  4/4/2022 -TAS Finishing the design review and plan on meeting two contractors the end of April to walk down the project and get bids.",1-May-23,"Griest, Barbara",,West,Pipelines and Terminals,Operating Infrastructure,,Sugar Creek,BETNB - BET COUNCIL BLUFFS,,"59,691","2,066",,,"233,636",,"Clark, Dave","Spari, Markella",,,1,34649,,"Guest, ProSight",Independent,Aqua,28-Aug-19,Other Programs

7/2/22 - sent a second email to RA asking for an update on when we can expect to see an invoice for this work.  Re-accruing the open PO amount of 20,389 until we receive the final invoice.

6/1/2022 - Tank taken OOS on 6/23 and cleaning finished on 6/27, DJA on site 5/31 to perform 653 inspection. Scope will be sent once preliminary report is received. Tank has a thick film liner and bottom showing soil side indications. DJA report called out tank critical zone failing. Panning to replace all sketch sheets. Updated forecasting for extensive mechanical repairs, hydrotest, and liner install. I believe this will be a medium scope. Forecasting for June includes beginning mechanical repairs and inspector costs. 

5/2/2022 - Held call on 5/3 with operations. Scheduling to take tank OOS on 5/23. Forecasting in May includes cleaning and inspector costs for one week. June forecasting includes inspection, mechanical repairs, and inspector costs.

3/1/2022 - Variance in February due to not ordering equipment. the current PLC set up for tank gauging requires outside engineering review to determine if it can handle a Varec 2920 in Modbus communication. Working with Mohammad and Triad on the PLC changes needed. Planning to take tank OOS in May.

11/8/22 - emailed Buckeye SSSP template back to RAM so they can fill out our template and need to schedule RAM personnel for PIC training and work through ISN Waiver.  Confidence level in getting this work started before cold temps arrive is going down so moving this FCST out to 2023.  If we can get everything completed for newvendor and temps are favorable we will try to get this completed in 2022.


10/31/22 - emailed HASP to Mike Sullivan and others for review on 10/24 and waiting on a reply back.  Supply Chain was working through insurance issues and still waiting on a resolution (RAM does not need pollution insurance since SOW does not impact operations aroundpiping).

10/10/22 - received proposal from RAM for 55,992 on 10/6 - working to get them added as a Buckeye vendor.

9/28/22 - had Ram Construction reach out to me and will be on-site on the 29th for site visit to get a proposal from them.

9/19/22 - had to create a new MEXP project for this work since the original entry was setup under MCAP.  Moved the FCST over this new MEXP project entry and cancelled the MCAP project in OPPM.  All notes below were copied over from the original MCAP project.9/8/22 - sent out email to leadership to review this revised SOW and details.  Checked with M+J and they can get it completed in 2022 and the waterproof coating can be applied down to 20 Deg F.

9/3/22 - talked with M+J to revise their original proposal to make lintel repairs where needed over 5 windows, replace the concreteblocks over the windows with the appropriate blocks and paint all of these blocks with an approved, waterproof coating that will address the permeability of the other concrete blocks.  Just waiting on this revised proposal.

8/1/22 - I think the original mailingwas delivered to River Rouge instead of PM's office.  Talked with M+J today and they shipping theiroriginal proposal to office overnight mail.  
 
7/6/22 - moving this FCST out to Aug since I do not have proposal from M+J yet.

5/31/22 - waiting on proposal - provided mailing address to M+J so just waiting on documentation.

5/18/22 - had a conf call with Nick and John from M+J Industrial on 5/4 to review the SOW.  Waiting on detailed SOW and cost estimate to see if we can break this out into 30' or 60' sections to replace in 2022 with maybe 90' sections annually.

4/10 - moved FCST out to Jun, still waiting ona proposal from Haley & Aldrich and M+J Industrial.  Things are moving slow with this project.

4/1/22 - contractors will be on-site Apr 4th to look at this and provide a Phase I estimate to address the leaks in the break room first.",2-Jul-23,"Hill, Elizabeth",,West,Pipelines and Terminals,Station/Terminal,,Wayne Terminal,BETHY - BET RIVER ROUGE,,"15,048","63,709",,,,,"Gardner, Travis","Gardner, Travis W.",,,1,45872,,"Meitzler, Antoinette",Independent,Aqua,19-Sep-22,Other Programs

1/2/23 - processed one invoice in Dec for shipping of the actuator.  Should be ready to close this project at the end of Jan.

11/30/22 - actuator installed on Nov 28th and has AC power to it and operates locally.  Chuck will work on getting this connected to the local HMI which is already setup for the control of this actuator/valve.

11/18/22 - actuator arrived on Nov 8th - just need local ops to get this installed and checked out back to SCADA.

11/8/22 - Var is due to delay in receiving actuator at factory, last update on Nov 7th is that actuator should arrive on Nov 8th - shifting FCST out another month.

10/3/22 - received email from Ken Nelson with HPC that there is a delay in receiving the actuator.  New estimated ship date is 10/17.

9/28/22 - have not received the actuator yet - sent Adam Krause with HPC an email requesting an shipping update.  Actuator should have arrived on Sep 26th - worst case.

9/3/22 - no change, expect delivery of actuator sometime around Sep 12 - 26 with installation in Oct.

8/1/22 - no change, expect delivery of actuator sometime around Sep 12 - 26.
